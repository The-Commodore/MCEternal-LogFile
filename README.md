# MCEternal-LogFile
Logfile of an eternally bootlooped MCEternal Server

It's exactly what it says on the tin.  My MCEternal server started boot-looping today, and I've no idea what changed.
The server is running the vanilla MCEternal ModPack (if such a statement can truly be made).
It's running on a MelonCube server, 10GB in size.  (So you can go see what the configurations are, if you'd like.)
